### Hi there, I'm Shayan Ali üëã

</p>

I'm a second-year **Bachelor of Cybersecurity** student at the University of Technology Sydney. I'm driven by a fascination with how digital systems work, and more importantly, how they can be broken. My goal is to leverage that understanding from an offensive security perspective to help organisations build more resilient and secure systems.

I believe in learning by doing, and my portfolio is a reflection of that philosophy‚Äîa collection of hands-on projects from analysing and defending against web vulnerabilities to building secure servers and private blockchains from scratch.

### üöÄ My Focus & Goals

*   üéì Deepening my knowledge through my **Bachelor of Cybersecurity** and the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.
*   üíª Applying theoretical concepts to hands-on projects, from building private blockchains to deploying secure cloud infrastructure.
*   üî¨ Focusing my self-study on penetration testing methodologies and tools in preparation for a career in ethical hacking.
